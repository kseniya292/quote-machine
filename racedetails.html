		<h3>Montezuma Half Marathon and 5K</h3>
		<h4>June 26, 2016</h4>
		<h4>8:15 AM  Half Marathon Start</h4>
        <h4>8:30 AM 5K Start</h4>

        <p>Nestled in the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York, the tiny town of Savannah — home to a population of just over 1,700 year-round residents — is set to play host to the inaugural Montezuma Half Marathon & 5K in the middle of summer this year, a race that will take runners along the grassy trails inside the Howland Island Unit of the Northern Montezuma Wildlife Management Area.<p>
 
		<p>This 3,500-acre island lies inside the Montezuma Wetlands Complex which includes  the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge.  These historic wetland areas include 18,000 acres of public lands named for the Montezuma Marshes, a 50,000-acre area of swamps and marshes that is one of the largest wetlands complexes in the northeast. The area is something of a mecca for bird-watching, as more than 200 species of birds have been observed on the Island. The island has been protected since the 1930s and today offers visitors a mix of woodland forests, grasslands and marshes, as well as plentiful hiking, biking and running trails throughout.</p>

		<h4>Race Weather & Climate</h4>
		<p>Located in western Upstate New York, about 140 miles east of Buffalo and roughly an hour’s drive from Rochester, Savannah typically sees its warmest weather of the year in July, which has brought record temperatures here as low as 39ºF (in 1932) and as high as 100ºF (in 1936).
